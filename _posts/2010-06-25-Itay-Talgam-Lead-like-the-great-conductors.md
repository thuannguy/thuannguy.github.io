I watched this video a few months ago. I could remember I couldn't leave my eyes out off, enjoyed it until the very last seconds.

Some interesting notes from the talk:

> The happiness does not come from his own story, and his joy of the music. The joy is about enabling other people's stories to be heard at the same time.

> You're a great conductor. We don't want to work with you. Please resign. (Because you don't let us develop. You're using us as instruments, not as partners.)

> If you sweat at the end of the concert, it means that you must have done something wrong.

> They look at Karajan, and then they look at each others. "Do you understand what this guy wants?"
> Karajan: The worst damage I can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction. Because this would prevent the ensemble, the listening to each other.

> It's like being on a rollercoaster: the forces of the process itself keep you in place.
> When it's needed, the authority is there. It's very important. But authority is not enough to make people your partners. 
> Kleiber not only creates a process, but also creates the conditions in the world in which this process takes place.

In summary:

> If you are doing all the things we talked about, together, and maybe others, you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing.
