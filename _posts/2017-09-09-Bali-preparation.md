This is the first of a series of blog posts about my recent trip to Bali. Due to my technical background, the posts will be more about a diary and tips than about typical posts with fancy words. Since I took the trip with my family including my elderly parents, I always favored convenience over anything else.

# When to visit Bali

The two most important things I always need to check before traveling to somewhere is when the weather is nice and when the peak time is. For weather, the dry season is from April to September and peak time is from July to August. Given the fact that I began to planning for the trip in May, start of September was ideal for me.

# How long a trip to Bali should be

My trip had 6 full days in Bali plus 2 days for flying. Because Bali is a big island with so many things to do, I could only explore half of Bali. Furthermore, after the trip I felt like I was just able to touch the "surface" of Bali. If possible at all, I would recommend at least two weeks.

# Preparation

After knowing when to go and how many days the trip would take, the first three steps of preparation were to book flights, hotels, and find a good private driver in Bali.

## Flights

Who doesn't like cheap flight tickets? I had two options which were either to wait for really cheap tickets or to buy the cheapest tickets I could find at the time of preparation. Because planning a trip for many people was not easy and I needed to finalize the plan ASAP, I decided to go with the latter. Although Tiger Airways seemed to offer the cheapest tickets, a friend of mine who is a booker showed me that after factoring in all fee and tax and luggage cost, flying with Singapore Airlines only cost about 10% more. Therefore, choosing Singapore Airlines was a no-brainer to me which turned out to be a very correct decision.

## Hotels

I will review the hotels I chose in later posts. Anyway, choosing hotels is so easy now with load of information from sites such as TripAdvisor, Booking, Agoda etc.

## Private driver

Since we wanted to explore Bali, which is a pretty big island, as much as possible, finding a good private driver who would drive us around Bali for the whole trip was necessary. Luckily, a friend of mine gave me contact of such a driver who took care of us very well. In addition, he helped me a lot with making an itinerary that has a balance between places to go, rest, and when to go where.
