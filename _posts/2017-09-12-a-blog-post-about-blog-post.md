# How to write a good blog post

So you want to [start a blog](https://www.thuannguy.com/blog/2017/09/10/how-to-start-a-blog/) and if you were taught about writing well at school as well as are a native English speaker, I guess writing in English should not be a problem. However, if you are like me who don't have both, you might be struggle a little bit with your writing. Even now, while I can't claim that I'm a good writer, I have learned a few things about writing throughout the years which I'm going to share here in the hope that someone may find it useful to some extend. The focus of this post is on organization, development, and correctness of a post. In the end, I will gradually add links to a few examples when I have time to write them.

Tip: This section, marked as heading 1, is where I can give an introduction about the post. It usually has a few sentences that helps reader know very quickly:

- What it is about. Have you ever read a lengthy article that even after you finished you still don't know what it is about? I have, many times.
- Who its target audiences are. In this case, the target audiences are young software developers who want to start a blog but don't have the necessary writing skills yet.
- What the audiences will get after reading it, or what the main arguments you are using to prove your point depending on particular topics.

It seems to me that most readers are always busy so you have just a minute (aka time to read a few first sentences) to convince them that your post is worthy a read. Btw, you can google for [thesis statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis_statement) if you want to learn more about how and the importance of this section.

## Start developing your post

After the introduction, you start developing your ideas from subsequent sections which you use "heading 2" for them. Some of the most popular topics are:

- A argumentative post about something: The most important argument.
- How to solve a problem you just had: Describe the problem in details.

## Continue on developing post

This section is all about continuing on the next point after the first one. 

- A argumentative post about something: Your second-most argument.
- How to solve a problem you just had: How you troubleshot it, why it happened.

## Closing down

- A argumentative post about something: Your final argument.
- How to solve a problem you just had: How you solved it.
