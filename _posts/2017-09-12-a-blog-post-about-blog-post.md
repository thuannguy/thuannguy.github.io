# How to write a good blog post

So you want to [start a blog](https://www.thuannguy.com/blog/2017/09/10/how-to-start-a-blog/) and if you were taught about writing well at school as well as are a native English speaker, I guess writing in English should not be a problem. However, if you are like me who don't have both, you might be struggle a little bit with your writing. Even now, while I can't claim that I'm a good writer, I have learned a few things about writing throughout the years which I'm going to share here in the hope that someone may find it useful to some extend. The focus of this post is on organization, development, and correctness of a post. In the end, I will gradually add links to a few examples when I have time to write them.

Analysis: This section, marked as heading 1, is where I can give an introduction about the post. It usually has a few sentences that helps reader know very quickly:

- What it is about. Have you ever read a lengthy article that even after you finished you still don't know what it is about? I have, many times.
- Who its target audiences are. In this case, the target audiences are young software developers who want to start a blog but don't have the necessary writing skills yet.
- What the audiences will get after reading it, or what the main arguments you are using to prove your point depending on particular topics.

It seems to me that most readers are always busy so you have just a minute (aka time to read a few first sentences) to convince them that your post is worthy a read. Btw, you can google for [thesis statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis_statement) if you want to learn more about how and the importance of this section.

## Start going into details

After the introduction, you start going into details and you should use "heading 2" for this section. If your post is about a problem, you have probably mentioned about in the introduction section and this section is where you describe it in details (1). Another case is that you want to write a post to make a point about something, this section is where you put your most important argument (2).

## Continue on developing post

This section is all about continuing on the next point after the first one. For posts of type (1), you can discuss about your solution for the problem. Meanwhile, your next argument should be the content of this section for posts of type (2). Please note that this section is continuation of the previous sections. You can have a few sections like this if you want to explore some aspects of the problem (1) or you have many other arguments (2).

## Always use a spell checker

Although you can be a non-native English speaker, there is no excuse for typos in your writing. You should always use a text editor that has a good spell checker.

## But you don't need to follow a single structure for every posts

There is simply no such thing as a best structure nor one that fits all kinds of blog posts. The one I'm writing about here is, in my opinion, a typical one that I have used for many posts with good result and I hope that it can help some of you who want to start writing.

## Closing down

After you have written about all necessary details, having a short summary section is usually a good idea. This section is where you can summarize content of the whole post that helps readers memorize the most important points you want to tell them. If you are interested in some sample posts, you can have a quick look at:

- [To be decided - an argumentative blog post](https://www.thuannguy.com/blog/)
- [Dependency injection - dealing with large object graph](https://www.thuannguy.com/blog/2017/07/21/Dependency-injection-dealing-with-large-object-graph-writing-analysis) for an example about a post that discusses about a specific problem.
- [To be decided - a post about a small problem I encountered in daily job](https://www.thuannguy.com/blog/)

Tip: Suggestion for further reading or a teaser about a future post is a good idea.

## Credits

Well, the summary section might not be the last section yet. If you use free materials such as images from other websites to decorate your posts, having a section to give credits is a good idea. Tip: make sure you search for materials that use Common Creative licenses.
