# Performance: from nothing to something

In this series I'm going to write about my little journey on writing high performance web application using Asp.Net (disclaimer: performance of my application is still not high enough yet!) with focus on knowing your targets, understanding the complexity of those targets, and working towards the targets. 

To start with, the most interesting observation is that in order to design and develop high performance application, you need to have a clear definition about what kind of performance you want to have. Throughout my career so far, I have gone through a few levels of definitions:

## 1. I didn't know/I didn't care
...
## 2. I thought I wrote good code
...
## 3. The "perceptive" high performance application
...
## 4. The ugly truth or SLAs
...
