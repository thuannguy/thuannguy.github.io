When I practice listening to prepare for the IELTS test, I always find it difficult to listen to people's names or phone numbers spelling and write them down. Thus, I decided to make an application which can spell numbers and names so that I can use it to practice.

If you are interested in the program, here is the link: (Sorry, link no longer works.)

Functionalities:

1.It supports name, number, and phone number.


2.The voice is not as clear as real human's one. Actually, I think this is a good thing because if you can beat it, real test won't be a problem anymore.


3.At the moment, the application uses a database which has 1000 names. Thanks beebole for this database.


4.Phone numbers and numbers are generated randomly.


 

I hope you will find it useful :-)
